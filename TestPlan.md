# Test Plan


## 1. Testing Strategy


#### 1.1 Overall strategy
*Describe the overall testing strategy. In this template only a few general all purpose categories are listed, feel free to expand and add to these for your specific development needs.*

##### 1.1.1 Unit Testing
*Most development, especially in an agile setting, uses unit testing. Here describe the unit testing that will be performed. This can involve list and describing the unit testing framework(s) that will be used and for which part of the application development the framework will be used. If there will be any general strategies being employed or specific guidelines being followed, these should be listed here as well.*

##### 1.1.2 Integration Testing  
*Most applications will have multiple parts that are connected by some sort of adapter or connector. In this section describe how the testing of part integration will take place (manually, unit tests, etc.).*

##### 1.1.3 System Testing
*Applications will run on one or multiple systems. Checks to ensure that they do not break at the system level must be conducted. This step does not have to be conducted often but at least once before each release. Describe here the method for testing that there are no incompatibilities between the system and application.*

##### 1.1.4 Regression Testing
*During continuing development as new features and functionality are added periodic testing must be conducted in an attempt to discover and detect new bugs or incompatibilities that arisen since the last release/commit. Here describe the strategy for testing the code to find these bugs. This is often done with unit tests or similar and performed before each commit and after each update.*

#### 1.2 Test Selection
*Here describe the strategy for selecting and identifying which areas of the application need to be tested. Where will **white-box** testing be used and where will **black-box** testing be used.* 

#### 1.3 Bug Tracking
*Here describe the strategy/tools that will be used to handle and record bugs and their fixes. This can be a combination of things that will lead to a more robust system.*

#### 1.5 Technology
*Here list/describe any additional additional relevant information about the tools and systems that will be used to conduct the testing of the application and its dependencies.

## 2. Test Cases
*In this section describe the test cases for the application and list which tool they are being conducted using. No subsections are given because they are to be filled in by the user. This section will be constantly expanding as development progresses. The purpose is to be a reference for both application developers and test developers. Expand as team sees fit.*
