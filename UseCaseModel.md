## 1. Use Case Diagram
*UML use case diagram*

## 2. Use Case Descriptions
*Add an in-depth description of each use case. This will provide further insight into how the application react to certain inputs and stimuli. It will also give insight into whether the use case is too specific or generic. Generic use cases can sometimes be split up into more specific cases. Specific use cases can sometimes be combined to make a more inclusive and intuitive case.*
